# üìù Job Vacancies REST API üìù
## Project Description
Job Vacancies REST API is a simple application that allows you to upload and store job vacancies in an H2 database. This API supports several endpoints, including retrieving a sorted and paginated list of all vacancies, retrieving detailed information about a vacancy by its ID, retrieving a list of the most visited vacancies' IDs, and retrieving a count of all vacancies grouped by location. The list of vacancies is updated on an hourly basis by a scheduler, and the frequency of the scheduler can be adjusted according to your needs.
